# Send Post App

I wanted to try my clean code performance. So, my first priority is writing clean code. But maybe I decide to develop this app later :)

## FAQ

#### Is this app responsive?

Exactly! I created my own responsive structure with extensions. I'm using width and height of screen in everywhere.

#### Why Firebase?

Because I have already experience on Rest Api. I also wanted to code and develop quickly alone.

## Development

As I said, I want to write clean code! So, I am trying to implement and use what I learn from my seniors and from who I follow developers!

#### What did I pay attention?

I paid attention to 'not repeat myself'. I try to use extract methods and classes. Also application file structure was important. It should be clear, understandable and can be improved.

I used the singleton in many code files. Because we do not want to create some classes more and more, right? 🤭

I used the extensions. For example, for getting height and width value of screen. (I've decided that I did not need to do this. Because GetX was already doing this. But it's okay, It was fun for me 💪🏻)

Long story short, I know that, I need to improve myself about clean code. But I'm trying my best! I'm sure, it will be better day by day. Let's review my codes! 🙂
